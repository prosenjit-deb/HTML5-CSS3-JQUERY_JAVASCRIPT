							<h3>Depression Literacy Among Dermatologists:</h3>
							<h2>An Online Survey Study in India</h2>
							<p>N. A. Uvais, MBBS, DPM; Ettappurath N. Abdul Latheef, MD; Bishurul Hafi, MD; Mohammed Jafferany, MD; Muhammed T. Razmi, MD; and T. P. Afra, MD</p>
							<h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
							<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Early and higher detection rates of depression among dermatology patients can lead to better prognosis. Increased depression literacy among dermatologists might play a vital role in the early and successful detection and treatment of depression among their patients. The objective of this study was to investigate depression literacy among dermatologists working in India.</p>
							<p><strong>Methods:</strong> An online survey with a questionnaire comprising sociodemographic variables and the Depression Literacy Questionnaire was conducted to collect data on depression literacy among dermatologists between July 6, 2019, and August 6, 2019. Sociodemographic variables included age, sex, educational qualification, practice location, practice duration, and practice type.</p>
							<p><strong>Results:</strong> The response rate was 56.99%. The majority of respondents were aged 31–50 years, female, and working in urban areas. The mean ± SD total score of the respondents was 17.4 ± 2.36, with the lowest score being 10 and the highest score 22. More correct answers (98.1%) were recorded for the items “loss of confidence and poor self-esteem may be symptoms of depression” and “sleeping too much or too little may be sign of depression.” The mean total score of female respondents was higher than that of men, and the difference was significant (P = .003).</p>
							<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> The study revealed good depression literacy status among dermatologists working in India. Female respondents were found to have higher depression literacy.</p>

							<p>Treatment-resistant depression (TRD), defined as a major depressive disorder accompanied by lack of response to more than 2 adequate antidepressant trials, is commonly associated with functional impairment, poor quality of life and well-being, suicide ideation and attempts, self-injurious behavior, and a high relapse rate.1 The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression study reported that up to 40% of patients with major depressive disorder met the TRD criteria and that over 33% of patients continued to have depression even after 4 trials of different antidepressant treatments—including combination therapy and augmentation therapy.2</p>
							<p>In the 2010s, increasing evidence has supported the fast-acting and promising antidepressant effect of low-dose ketamine infusion in patients with TRD, with up to 65% and 50% of TRD patients reaching the response state after ketamine infusion in Western studies and in a Taiwanese study, respectively.3–5 Several studies have investigated the clinical predictors of treatment response to ketamine infusion in patients with TRD, suggesting that a family history of an alcohol use disorder in a first-degree relative, nonmelancholic and melancholic-anxious features, moderate or severe anhedonia at baseline, and the absence of a prior suicide attempt predicted the likelihood of response.6–9 However, only a few studies have examined the relationship between subjective psychological experience during ketamine infusion and the antidepressant response of ketamine infusion in patients with TRD.6,10 Pennybaker et al6 reported an association between dissociation during ketamine infusion and better antidepressant response. However, Luckenbaugh et al11 reported that dissociative and psychotomimetic symptoms were not related to improvements in depressive symptoms at postinfusion. In addition, Aust et al10 demonstrated that ketamine-induced anxiety during infusion had a negative effect on the antidepressant efficacy of ketamine.</p>
							<p>In previous studies, the feeling of happiness during ketamine infusion has been rarely mentioned but often observed.12 Gaydos et al12 compared the performance in basic soldiering tasks among 48 healthy volunteers who received the standard battlefield analgesic (10 mg IM morphine) and 25 mg IM ketamine. They found that, relative to morphine and placebo administration, participants reported greater feelings of happiness—in addition to other symptoms such as dizziness and poor concentration—when given ketamine. Specifically, happiness is a subjective experience of positive affect and is often called subjective well-being or emotional well-being.13 The lack of positive affect is likely to be more common and is usually seen in different stages of major depressive disorder, including the acute, chronic, and remitted phases.14,15 Moreover, traditional antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are not effective in treating positive affect deficits.14 Oren-Yagoda et al16 determined that during a pharmacotherapy pretreatment and the administration of cognitive-behavioral therapy, compared with negative affect, positive affect was a much better predictor of depressive symptoms after treatment.</p>
							<p>In this study, we reanalyzed data from the Adjunctive Ketamine Study of Taiwanese Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression. That study involved 71 patients with TRD who were randomly administered 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, or a saline placebo. </p>
							<h4>METHODS</h4>
							<strong>Inclusion Criteria and Study Procedure</strong>
							<p>The study design, patient enrollment, and clinical results of the current clinical trial study have been previously published.4,17 Between 2012 and 2015, 71 adult patients with TRD with no history of major medical or neurologic diseases or alcohol or substance use disorders were enrolled in our study. Major depressive disorder was diagnosed based on the criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). Participants received 40-minute intravenous infusions and were randomly assigned to be administered 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg of ketamine, or a saline placebo. Depressive symptoms were examined using a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). HDRS measurements were conducted prior to infusion; at 40, 80, 120, and 240 minutes postinfusion; and, sequentially, on days 2 to 7 and 14 postinfusion.18 This study accorded with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Taipei Veterans General Hospital Institutional Review Board. All participants gave their informed consent (clinical trial registration: UMIN Clinical Trials Registry; registration number: UMIN000016985).</p>
							<strong>Definition of Happiness During Infusion</strong>
							<p>The visual analog scale for happiness (VASH) was used for the assessment of happiness. The standard question for happiness evaluation was used in our study: Please rate your feeling of happiness (幸福 Xìngfú) from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very) now.19 Xìngfú indicates the subjective feeling of well-being and happiness in Mandarin Chinese. VASH measurements were conducted prior to infusion, at 20 minutes during infusion, and at 40 minutes postinfusion. Subjective happiness at the moment was rated by every subject. Subjects whose VASH scores at either 20 minutes during infusion or 40 minutes postinfusion were higher than the baseline (prior to infusion) were defined as the happiness during infusion group, and subjects not in this group were defined as the nonhappiness during infusion group. In addition, to assess whether happiness during infusion was related to ketamine-related psychotomimetic symptoms, the positive symptoms subscale (suspiciousness, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, unusual thought content, grandiosity, and disorientation) of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-P) was used to measure the potential ketamine-related psychotomimetic effects at 40 minutes postinfusion.20 Furthermore, in order to clarify whether ketamine-related happiness may persist at postinfusion and to ensure that happiness was not just a byproduct of the side effects of ketamine,21 VASH measurements of subjective happiness were assessed at 80 minutes, day 3, day 7, and day 14 postinfusion.</p>
							<strong>Statistical Methods</strong>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
									<p>Continuous variables and nominal variables were analyzed using 1-way analysis of variance and Fisher χ2 tests, respectively, to assess differences between the two subgroups (happiness during infusion vs nonhappiness during infusion) with respect to demographic and clinical data. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model, with an autoregressive method for correlations of repeated measures for the same subject over time, was used to examine the effects of ketamine on reduction of HDRS scores during the study period. The GEE included between-patient factors, which comprised infusion type (0.5 mg/kg or 0.2 mg/kg ketamine or placebo) and infusion response type (happiness during infusion vs nonhappiness during infusion); a single within-patient factor, which was time (baseline, 40 and 240 minutes postinfusion, and days 2 to 7 and 14); and all possible interactions.

							<p>further assessment of the effects of ketamine on depression symptoms and subjective happiness during the study period. These models included the infusion response type as a between-patient factor, time as a within-patient factor, and baseline depression score as a between-patient predictor, in addition to all possible interactions. In addition, stratified by infusion response type, GEE models (with the autoregressive method for correlations of repeated measures for the same subject over time) were used to examine the effects of ketamine on depression symptoms during the study period. These models included the treatment group as a between-patient factor, time as a within-patient factor, and baseline depression score as a between-patient predictor, in addition to all possible interactions. Finally, a general linear model—adjusting for age, sex, treatment group, and baseline HDRS scores—was used to analyze the association between the changes in VASH and BPRS-P scores at 40 minutes postinfusion and the association between the changes in VASH scores at 40 minutes postinfusion and HDRS scores at each time point (baseline, 40 and 240 minutes, days 2 to 7 and 14). Finally, effect size of Cohen d was calculated to assess the predictive power of happiness vs nonhappiness during infusion for treatment response. A 2-tailed P .05 was considered statistically significant. All data processing and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 17 (SPSS Inc).
</p>

<strong>RESULTS</strong>
<p>
In total, 44 (62%) patients with TRD reported feelings of happiness during infusion (Table 1). Relative to the nonhappiness group, the happiness during infusion group had similar baseline scores for HDRS (23.25 ± 4.52 vs 22.93 ± 4.65, P = .773) and lower baseline scores for VASH (2.82 ± 1.91 vs 4.26 ± 3.26, P = .021) (Table 1).

								The dose-dependent effect of ketamine in the reduction of depressive symptoms was noted only in the happiness during infusion group 
(P = .002) and not in the nonhappiness during infusion group (P = .341) (Figure 2). In addition, changes in VASH and BPRS-P scores at 40 minutes postinfusion were not associated (P > .05). However, changes in VASH scores at 40 minutes postinfusion were significantly related to changes in HDRS scores at each time point from 40 minutes to day 7 (all P < .05).

							<h5>DISCUSSION</h5>
							<p>Our findings support the study’s hypothesis that subjective happiness during ketamine infusion predicted the antidepressant effect of both 0.5 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion over time. Happiness during ketamine infusion, which was not related to the psychotomimetic effect of ketamine, was significantly associated with the reduction of depressive symptoms during the follow-up. Furthermore, the between-group significance of ketamine’s antidepressant effect was only noted among patients with TRD who experienced happiness during infusion.</p>
							<p>As mentioned in the introduction, several clinical markers, such as features of melancholic and anxious distress, history of attempted suicide, and ketamine-induced anxiety during infusion, may negatively predict the treatment response of ketamine.6–9 Our study is the first to suggest the positive role of subjective happiness during infusion in the antidepressant effect of low-dose ketamine infusion. Studies have reported the predictive role of positive affect, such as happiness or joy, in the therapeutic outcome of pharmacotherapy and nonpharmaceutical interventions for depression.22–24 Gorwood et al23 assessed the subjective feelings of joy and sadness during a 6-week antidepressant treatment among 2,049 adult outpatients with depression and found that an increase in joy at week 2 positively predicted treatment response and functional improvement at week 6. Suterwala et al22 examined positive affect immediately after an acute exercise session, where the treatment response was a combination therapy of antidepressants and public-health-dose exercise; they discovered that positive affect after exercise significantly predicted the antidepressant response of the combination therapy. Geschwind et al24 further discovered that early improvements in positive affect during the first week of antidepressant treatment predicted response and remission at week 6, with moderate to large effect sizes. Unlike the slow effect of traditional antidepressants on human affect, low-dose ketamine potentially induces positive affect (happiness) rapidly during infusion. The positive affect during infusion should be considered a clinical predictor of the antidepressant effect of ketamine.</p>
							<p>The positron emission tomography (PET) results of our previous study may partially explain the mechanism underlying the predictive role of happiness during infusion in the antidepressant response of ketamine.17 Li et al17 examined glucose metabolism in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) prior to and immediately after a low-dose ketamine infusion, finding that both 0.5 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusions, but not a normal saline placebo infusion, resulted in increases in the glucose metabolism of the PFC and ACC. In the PFC, differences in glucose metabolism significantly predicted antidepressant responses 40 and 240 minutes after treatment.17 Studies have demonstrated the crucial role of the PFC and ACC in the feeling of happiness.25–28 A recent systematic review revealed that regardless of the neuroimaging technique used (PET and functional magnetic resonance imaging), activation in PFC and ACC was associated with the autobiographical recall of happy events.27 Examining the influences of subjective happiness on emotion-related prefrontal activity using multichannel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), Oonishi et al25 reported that subjects with a high subjective happiness score had a higher frequency of increased oxygenated hemoglobin in the left PFC when viewing pleasant pictures. Based on our hypothesis that the antidepressant effect of ketamine is driven by rapid activation in the PFC—which functions as a kindler and is followed by persistent increases in glucose metabolism in both the dorsal ACC and supplementary motor area—happiness during ketamine infusion can be regarded as a clinical phenomenon involving rapid activation in the PFC.29,30 Our study implies that the only people with TRD who respond to low-dose ketamine infusion are those who experience happiness during infusion and exhibit PFC activation.</p>
							<p>This study has several limitations. First, we used only VASH for the assessment of happiness during infusion. This was because in the subanesthetic state, patients might be unable to complete a long questionnaire for happiness, such as rating their experience on a positive and negative affect scale. Further studies may be necessary for clearer measurements of the subjective emotional experience during infusion with respect to treatment response to ketamine. Second, our study was an add-on ketamine study because in severely depressed patients, it is arguably more ethical for the medications used in the study to be the same as those prescribed to them. Therefore, the feeling of happiness during infusion may be more appropriately explained by the add-on effect of a low-dose ketamine infusion. Third, further investigation is required to determine whether happiness during infusion is related to PFC activation. The fNIRS is a potential technique for the continual recording of brain function during ketamine infusion. Fourth, the subjective feelings during low-dose ketamine infusion may be quite different among individuals and between patients and healthy volunteers.31 In our study, we found that subjective happiness during ketamine infusion was related to positive treatment responses among patients with TRD. As mentioned, subjective anxiety during infusion was associated with negative treatment responses among patients with TRD.10 In addition, Gaydos et al12 reported that healthy volunteers experienced the feelings of happiness during ketamine infusion, but Nugent et al31 suggested the opposite finding that ketamine’s effects in healthy subjects may represent a potential model for dysphoria. With regard to ketamine as a hallucinogen, the reason why different persons may experience different feelings during infusion would need further investigation. The conflicting results may remind clinicians to closely monitor patients’ subjective feelings, such as happiness and anxiety, during ketamine infusion because these feelings may be associated with treatment responses.</p>
							<p>In conclusion, happiness during ketamine infusion may predict the treatment response of low-dose ketamine infusion. The increase in subjective happiness during infusion was not related to the psychotomimetic effect of ketamine but was associated with the reduction in depressive symptoms during the follow-up. Further studies may be required to validate our findings and to investigate the neurobiological mechanism between ketamine-induced happiness and the antidepressant effect of ketamine infusion.</p>
